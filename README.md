# Hello-World
Just another repositroy

My name is Ellie Bell and I very much enjoy learning new things and doing exotic things.
A few years ago I actually, forr the first time ever, ate a tree covvered in chocolate. the whole thing. Ever since then, I've just never been the same. I crave trees quite often, and everythime I see one my mouth waters.
